# Deno Concept

This is a proof of concept project using *Oak* & *Denon*.

## Getting started
1. [Install Deno](https://deno.land) itself if your haven't already, or run `deno upgrade` if you are below version 1.0
2. [Install Deno VS-Code extension](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno) if that's your IDE of choice
3. [Install Denon](https://github.com/denosaurs/denon) - remember to add it to your PATH

Now just run `denon` to see available scripts or `denon start` to start the server.
